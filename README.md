Java School Management Ssytem

This a simple personal project for me to practice my java skills

A School Management system that will read a file that has commands and data to add/print the students and teachers and their information.

If you are reading this, please offer some feedback if you want to on how I can improve, other ideas to make this even better.

I will add more commands like deleting students (expelling) or deleting teachers (firing)

Maybe a way for students to change their major, add a another major, add a minor
Or maybe Teachers can change what subject they teach, add more subjects, drop one

It's a work in progress, so let me know what you would change/improve!

Thank you for reading!
